HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example, grade=84 will be rounded to 85 but grade=29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Solution:

public static List<Integer> gradingStudents(List<Integer> grades) {
    // Write your code here
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for(int i=0; i<grades.size(); i++){
            int score = grades.get(i);
            if((5-score%5)<3 && score>=38){
                res.add(score+(5-score%5));
            }else{
                res.add(score);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
