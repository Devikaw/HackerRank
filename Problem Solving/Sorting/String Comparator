Function Description

Declare a Checker class that implements the comparator method as described. It should sort first descending by score, then ascending by name. 
The code stub reads the input, creates a list of Player objects, uses your method to sort the data, and prints it out properly.

Solution:

class Checker implements Comparator<Player> {
  	// complete this method
	public int compare(Player a, Player b) {
        if(b.score!=a.score){
            return b.score-a.score;
        }
        return a.name.compareTo(b.name);       
    }
}
